This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Cicagon Public Library

Previously, this project used the name of the Chicago Public Library.
However, there is no affiliation between the reation of this chatbot and the Chicago Public Library. 
As such, the information provided by the AI is not true and can not be attributed to the Chicago Public Library. Thus, the name of the library has been changed. 
This is merely a project and the Chicago Public Library was originally choosen as the library attached to the Ai because of its prominence and reach. 

## Customer Support AI Chatbot

This Chatbot uses the Gemini API for the backend. The original frontend was mostly based on Bill Zhang's tutorial on teh subject. It has since undergone changes.

Hopefully, RAG will be implemented to improve the responses of the AI. Currently, its knowledge is limited and based on multiple small prompts and interactions.
